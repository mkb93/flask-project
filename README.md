#self led project that i want to include these things:


figure out what i want to make (has a sign in function, has a data storage function like todo list, able to access data in from different areas crud style, incorporate ai to search for relevant material, want it deployed, want to use a python backend and react from end but am willing to be flexible the same with the database i saw an interest post about using sqllite so you can have a special database on github pages)

# idea social app
  a way to track your friends schedules and synchronise them with yours.
  login to your account send requests to google calenders 
  take api data from their google calender that you use to visuals their schedule and compare with yours.
  have a visual representation of the network you have and how it intertwines. 
  have a visual element that helps to clarify the type of friendship you have with them.
    example:
      gym friends see them at the gym, interested, career, hobby and family details might be includedbut they would primarily be gym friends. what does that mean? a gym friend is a friend you can schedule workouts and activities at the gym with? you wouldnt go to a club night with them. but you might do something gym adjacent like suggest doing a 5k time trial.

# idea note taking that lines up with learning
  a way to easily track your thoughts and store them in areas that are relevant
    example:
      you have some thoughts about relationships that also overlap with psychology and you happen to be exploring both schools of thought. the thought would appear in both areas of learning. however, it wont link if you havent already started a school of thought line.
  use a database to easily access data and organise it relevantly
  host the database in a cheap and efficient way
  have an api that can interact with the database in CRUD capacity
  have a frontend that is simple and functional probably REACT maybe typescript
  implement testing for backedn and frontend in ways that seem relevant
  ## questions????
    how will you record data?
    what will you use to visualise the data?
    what is the point of storing data like this?
    will there be restrictions on how data is stored?
# idea hotpot manager
  manage the dates and location that hotpot pots are hosted. manage the ingredients that are preferred and where we get our ingredients from.
  maybe check the tian tian has an api
  we can also make like a tracker to find top hotpotters and also most locations
